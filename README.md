# Entra AI Agent Monitor
PowerShell-based visibility tool to identify and assess **AI-related applications and agents**
operating within **Microsoft Entra ID**.
This repository focuses on **governance, visibility, and risk awareness** for AI-enabled
applications that authenticate, access data, or act on behalf of users or workloads in
Microsoft Entra ID.
---
## What this tool does
- Identifies AI-related **enterprise applications and service principals**
- Reviews:
 - App permissions (delegated and application)
 - Consent posture (user vs admin)
 - Ownership gaps
 - Sign-in activity
- Assigns a **rule-based risk level** (Low / Medium / High)
- Generates:
 - JSON output (source of truth)
 - Static HTML report (CISA/NIST-style, tabular, printable)
This tool is designed for **visibility only**, not enforcement.
---
## How AI agents are represented in Entra ID
Microsoft Entra ID does not have a native “AI agent” object.
In this report, **AI agents are represented as**:
- Enterprise Applications
- App registrations / Service Principals
- Workload identities
- Third-party AI SaaS integrations (bots, plugins, copilots)
All analysis is based on **standard Entra ID and Microsoft Graph signals**.
---
## Quick usage (v0.1 – sample data)
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\Invoke-AIAgentMonitor.ps1
```
This generates sample JSON and HTML output without connecting to Microsoft Graph.
---
## Output
Generated files are written to the out folder:
- ai-agent-monitor.json (Structured findings used as the source of truth)
- ai-agent-monitor.html (Human-readable, tabular report suitable for Admin review, Audit evidence, Security discussions)
---
## Report format (CISA/NIST style)
The HTML report includes:
- Executive summary
- AI application inventory (tabular)
- Risk labels (Low / Medium / High)
- Expandable per-app details
- Optional raw JSON (collapsed)
No JavaScript frameworks or external dependencies are used.
---
## What this tool does NOT do
- Does not inspect AI prompts or model behavior
- Does not monitor content generated by AI
- Does not perform real-time threat detection
- Does not enforce Conditional Access or policies
- Does not replace Microsoft Defender or Sentinel
This tool complements — not replaces — existing security tooling.
---
## Current status
🚧 v0.1 – Structure and reporting scaffold
- Folder structure finalized
- CISA-style HTML reporting implemented
- Sample data output only
- Microsoft Graph collectors to be added next
---
## Roadmap (planned)
- Microsoft Graph data collection
- Detection of high-risk permissions
- Conditional Access coverage analysis
- Consent and ownership governance checks
- Dev tenant testing and validation
